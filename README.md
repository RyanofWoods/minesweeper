## Background

Based on the classic game, [Minesweeper](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=minesweeper+windows). I tried to recreate the game mechanics and look as close to the classic as possible.

## Objective
The board is divided into `tiles`. There may be a `mine` behind it or not. Your goal to open/sweep all tiles with no mine on them. If you click on a mine you lose. If you open all other tiles, you win.

When you left-click on a tile with no mine, it will show how many mines are surrounding that tile; use this to help you. If that number is none, the tile will `cascade` and open up adjacent tiles with no surrounding mines.

You can also right-click tiles to `flag` them as an indicator to yourself that you think there is a mine there. At the start of the game, you are given as many flags as there are mines. The top-left counter is your flags left.

Click the face emoji to `restart` the game.

### Choose from 3 difficulties:
- **Beginner** (9 x 9, 10 mines)
- **Intermediate** (16 x 16, 40 mines)
- **Expert** (30 x 16, 99 mines)


**Your first click is guaranteed to not have a mine.**
*Good luck!*
